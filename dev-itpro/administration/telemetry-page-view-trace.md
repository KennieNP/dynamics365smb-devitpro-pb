# Analyzing Page View Telemetry

**INTRODUCED IN:** [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] 2020 release wave 1, version 16.3

Page view telemetry gathers data about the pages that users open in the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] client. Each page view tells you how long it took to open the page, information about the user's environment, and more.

Use the data to gather statistics about system usage and also troubleshoot performance issues caused by the users' environments.

> [!NOTE]
> In Application Insights, telemetry about page views is logged to the **pageViews** table and not the **traces** table like other [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] traces. This also means that you can use the built-in pages in the **Usage** feature of the Application Insights to investigate how users interact with the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] environment. For more information, see [Usage analysis with Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/usage-overview).
